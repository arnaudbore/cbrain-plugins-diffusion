<h1>Description of the tool Dipy</h1>

<b><center>Document your task's purpose in the HTML excerpt.</center></b>

<p>
This file will be shown as a (Info) link in the Tools index page.
As a task programmer you are meant to explain what your task does.

Note that this file is NOT a .erb template, and so no dynamic content
is possible here. If you need to include images from your static
assets in your task's "public" directory, you will have to hardcode
a path like this:

    <img href="cbrain_plugins/cbrain_tasks/dipy/publicfile.jpg">

which will work AFTER you install the task with rake
cbrain:plugins:install:all (because some symbolic links need to be
set up).

Please remove this comment block once you've finished editing this file...
