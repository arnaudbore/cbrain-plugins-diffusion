<h1>Description of the options for Dipy</h1>

<b><center>Document your task's parameters in this HTML template.</center></b>

<p>
This file will be shown as a (Help) link at the top of the task's
parameters form.  As a task programmer you are meant to explain
what your task does, and what all your little input elements mean.

Note that this file is NOT a .erb template, and so no dynamic content
is possible here. If you need to include images from your static
assets in your task's "public" directory, you will have to hardcode
a path like this:

    <img href="cbrain_plugins/cbrain_tasks/dipy/publicfile.jpg">

which will work AFTER you install the task with rake
cbrain:plugins:install:all (because some symbolic links need to be
set up). We highly suggest not including too many pictures in this
file, as it shows as an overlay in the task's parameters form.

Please remove this comment block once you've finished editing this file...
